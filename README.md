# Inventory Data Analysis with OpenAI GPT-3

This project is an example of how to use Python, MongoDB, and the OpenAI GPT-3 API to perform data analysis on inventory data. The code demonstrates how to load data from a MongoDB database, use a Marshmallow schema for validation, and then request data analysis using OpenAI GPT-3.

## Requirements ðŸ“‹

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the code:

- `pymongo`: For interacting with MongoDB.
- `marshmallow`: For defining and validating a data schema.
- `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `openai`: For using the OpenAI API.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pymongo marshmallow python-dotenv openai
```

# Configuration âš™

Create a .env file: Create a file named .env in your project directory and define the environment variables following the example in the .env.template file.

# Execution ðŸš€

Once you've set up your environment, you can run the provided Python script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
